## About TAICO

The [Toronto Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity Organization (TAICO)](https://taico.ca) is a group of AI and cybersecurity experts who meet monthly to discuss the latest trends and technologies in the field. Baish is a project of TAICO.

## Suggested Usage - LLM Context Window

At this time, it is best to use a LLM provider that has a large context window, for example Anthropic, which has a 200,000 token context window. Using other LLMs with a short context window may currently result in errors, which is not necessarily their fault, it's that Baish needs more work to deal with small context windows. OpenAI has a 128K token window as well for most models. Best to use a provider that has a large context window, at least greater than 8192 tokens.

## Features

- Accepts files on stdin, ala the `curl | bash` pattern, but instead you would do `curl | baish --shield | bash`
- Can analyze any file, not just shell scripts curled to bash
- Analyzes scripts using various configurable LLMs for potential security risks
- Provides a harm score (1-10) indicating potential dangerous operations (higher is more dangerous)
- Provides a complexity score (1-10) indicating how complex the script is (higher is more complex)
- Saves downloaded scripts for later review 
- Logs all requests and responses from LLMs along with the script ID
- Uses YARA rules and other heuristics to detect potential prompt injection

## Large Language Model Provider Support

Baish currently supports the following providers:

* Cohere 🇨🇦
* Groq
* Anthropic
* OpenAI
* Experimental support for Ollama for local LLMs, e.g. llama3, mistral, etc.

It is straightforward to add support for other providers, pretty much anything LangChain supports, and contributions are welcome!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* An API key from a supported LLM provider, e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc. or a local LLM.
* Knowing which model from the provider you are going to use.
* Python 3.10 or later
* pip or pip3 installed
* libmagic (for file type detection)
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install libmagic1`
  * RHEL/CentOS: `dnf install file-libs`
  * macOS: `brew install libmagic`

### Install

* Ensure to have the prerequisites installed
* Install with pipx is recommended
* Install with the install script is also supported, as it creates a virtual environment and installs the prerequisites for you
* Install with pip is also supported

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have prerequisites installed. Currently the install script won't install the prerequisites for you.

On Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install libmagic1
```

On macOS:

```bash
brew install libmagic
```

#### Install with pipx

First, install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). There are instructions for Mac, Linux, and Windows on the pipx website.

Then, install baish with pipx:

```bash
pipx install baish
```

Follow the pipx instructions to setup the alias in your shell, and at that point you can run `baish` as normal.

#### Install with pip

>NOTE: It's recommended to use pipx to install baish, as it creates a virtual environment to install the dependencies in.

```bash
pip install baish
```

### Configure

Ensure to set your API key in your environment variables, e.g. `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...` or `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...`

Edit the `~/.baish/config.yaml` file to your liking.

Now you can run baish!

## Usage

* Technically, you can pipe any file to baish, but it's really meant to be used with shell scripts, especially via the `curl evil.com/evil.sh | baish` pattern.

```bash
curl -sSL https://thisisapotentiallyunsafescript.com/script.sh | baish
```

Baish will output the harm score, complexity score, and an explanation for why the script is either safe or not.

You can also run using the `--input` flag, which will read from a file instead of stdin.

```bash
baish --input some-script.sh
```

### Setting Provider and Model

You can set the provider and model in the `config.yaml` file.   

E.g. `config.yaml`:

```yaml
default_llm: haiku # default model to use
llms:
  haiku: # memorable name
    provider: anthropic # provider name
    model: claude-3-5-haiku-latest # model name
    temperature: 0.1 # temperature

  other_model:
    provider: groq
    model: llama3-70b-8192
    temperature: 0.1
```

### Using Ollama

If using Ollama, you can also specify the base URL, though it will default to `http://localhost:11434` if not specified.

```yaml
other_model:
  provider: ollama
  model: llama3:latest
  url: http://localhost:11434
```

Currently our prompt is quite long, and for example when using llama3, the prompt length is 2048 by default, so you may see errors like this:

```
time=2024-12-08T11:22:33.343-05:00 level=WARN source=runner.go:129 msg="truncating input prompt" limit=2048 prompt=2815 keep=25 new=2048
```

You can increase the context window with the following command:

```
$ ollama run llama3 /set parameter num_ctx 4096
You've set the `num_ctx` parameter to 4096. This parameter is used in some machine 
learning models, such as transformer-based architectures, and specifies the number of 
context windows or attention heads to use.
<output abbreviated>
```

## Examples

Here's a few examples of real world scripts that Baish can help you analyze before execution. These are mostly about installing real world software.

│ This script is a Linux installer for Ollama, a software package. It installs Ollama │
│ on the system, detects the operating system architecture, and installs the          │
│ appropriate version of Ollama. It also checks for and installs NVIDIA CUDA drivers  │
│ if necessary. The script uses various tools and commands to perform these tasks,    │
│ including curl, tar, and dpkg. The script is designed to be run as root and         │
│ modifies the system by installing software and configuring system settings.         │
│                                                                                     │

```

Install rvm:

```
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | baish --debug
```

Install rust:

```
curl --silent https://sh.rustup.rs | baish
```

Install docker:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | baish --debug
```

### Shield Mode

Baish can also be used in "shield" mode, which will error out if the script is not safe.

```
curl -sSL https://thisisapotentiallyunsafescript.com/script.sh | baish -s | bash
```

E.g. of running an unsafe script through baish in shield mode, where bash will execute the output of baish, in this case outputting an error message:

```bash
$ cat tests/fixtures/secret-upload.sh | baish -s | bash
Script unsafe: High risk score detected
```

Or without piping to bash. Note how the output is a "script" itself, echoing the output to the terminal which bash will then execute:

```bash
$ cat tests/fixtures/secret-upload.sh | baish -s
echo "Script unsafe: High risk score detected"
```

## Logging and Stored Scripts

Baish logs all requests and responses from LLMs along with the script ID. It also saves the script to disk with the ID so it can be reviewed later.

Below we see the results of one Baish run.

```
$ tree ~/.baish/
/home/ubuntu/.baish/
├── logs
│   └── 2024-12-05_15-50-43_c6f3de91_llm.jsonl
└── scripts
    └── 2024-12-05_15-50-43_c6f3de91_script.sh

3 directories, 2 files
```

## Known Issues

* LLMs with short context windows (like some local models) may fail to analyze longer scripts due to prompt length limitations. Even commercial models with short context windows can fail to analyze longer scripts.
